# Lost-Found iOS App
My Computer Science Final Project. An iOS App for uploading all kind of items you have lost/found. 


## Description :memo:

This project was developed as my final's degree project, which was developed during approximately half a year, with the guidance of a senior iOS developer, from who I could learn (and apply) the newest, and most used patterns and structures (such as MVVM or Coordination Pattern).

## Getting Started :movie_camera:

To get a copy of the project up and running of your local machine, you will need a MacOS environment with  ```Xcode``` installed (latest version preferred).


### Installing

After the project is downloaded, to load it you just have to double click on the ```.xcworkspace``` file to launch the project with Xcode. Then choose the way you want to execute the application (for example, on the Iphone Simulator).

Consider it will take some time to get the project (and libraries) fully indexed.
